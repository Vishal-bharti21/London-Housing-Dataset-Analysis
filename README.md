# London-Housing-Dataset-Analysis
The London Housing Dataset Analysis project utilizes Python and Pandas to process and analyze real estate data from London. The project aims to clean, transform, and derive insights from the dataset to understand housing trends in different boroughs over time.

**Features**

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns.

Feature Engineering: Extracting year from the date column for trend analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns in house prices across London boroughs.

Aggregation: Grouping data by boroughs and years to analyze trends.

Data Visualization: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical representation.

**Technologies Used**

Python (for data processing and analysis)

Pandas (for data manipulation and cleaning)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (for interactive development)

**Future Improvements**

Incorporating external economic indicators for deeper analysis.

Building predictive models to forecast housing prices.

Implementing interactive dashboards using Power BI or Metabase.
